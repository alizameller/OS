write.out exits with a SIGSEGV. This is because the execution starts at the first opcode after .text, but it continues through whatever comes next until a jump, interrupt or system call occurs to redirect the path of execution. Without an explicit exit system call to indicate the conclusion of the program, the execution continues into memory and is almost certain to to hit something non-executable which causes the segmentation fault.
