The instruction "movl $-1, %ebx", sets the first parameter of the Write system call to "-1". This is not a valid file descriptor because file descriptors are strictly greater than or equal to 0. This results in an EBADF, as seen in the output using strace, which is exactly as expected. The exit code still remains the same, because there is no error handling at the assembly level. Had I moved the value contained in %eax into %ebx before the exit syscall, the return value would have been -1.
